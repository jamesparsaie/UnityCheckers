# UnityCheckers
Game of Checkers developed within Unity and leveraging AWS for database and server hosting support

This purpose of this project was to get more familiar with working within the Unity environment, as well as being able to utilize AWS to support the project. This is currently a work in progress and will continue to get updated over the next few weeks.
